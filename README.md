# WPA/WPA2 Password Cracker
Code was part of course I did at university.

Code does crack passwords for known PMKID. I wouldn't recommend to use it, since hashcat will be faster, but feel free to do so.
It has zero capabilites to get PMKID oder handshakes. Everything it does is password cracking. Current implementation does only support 22000 hash method. 
You can find cap and pcap to 22000 converter here:
